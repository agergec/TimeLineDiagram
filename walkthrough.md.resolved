# Timeline Diagram Editor - Walkthrough

## What Was Built

A single-page web application for creating professional timeline diagrams with cascaded events on swim lanes.

## Recently Added Features

### Lane Management 2.0
- **Insert Lanes Anywhere**: New control buttons allow inserting lanes *before* or *after* any existing lane
- **Reorder Lanes**: Move lanes up or down with dedicated arrow buttons
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Drag lane handles to reorder them visually

### Enhanced Time Visualization
- **End Time Display**: Box properties now clearly show the calculated End Time (Start + Duration)
- **Floating Tooltips**: Hover over any box to see a comprehensive tooltip with Label, Start, Duration, and End times
- **Vertical Time Markers**: Smart indicators at the bottom of the screen show the start and end times of every box vertically, avoiding overlap

### UI Refinements & Smart Tools
- **Smart Time Markers**: Time markers are now displayed horizontally with tick marks, matching the box color. They automatically stack vertically to avoid overlapping text and update in real-time during drags.
- **Auto-Color Palette**: Features a built-in 16-color palette. New lanes get unique colors, and boxes within a lane receive subtle lighting variations for better visual distinction.
- **Smart Start Picker**: Added a "📍" button to the box properties. Click it, then click any box on the canvas to snap the selected box's start time to that target's end time.
- **Enhanced Lane Controls**: Controls are now compacted into a narrow "⋮" strip on the right, expanding on hover. This ensures the lane name is always editable.
- **Polished Visuals**: Boxes now have a subtle border for contrast, and alignment guides are more visible on all backgrounds.
- **Refined Interaction**: Box creation now requires a drag, preventing accidental creations from single clicks.
- **Improved Exports**: SVG and PNG exports now include vertical alignment lines.
