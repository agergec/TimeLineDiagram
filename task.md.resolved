# Timeline Diagram Web Application

## Planning
- [x] Analyze requirements and reference image
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Get user approval on plan

## Implementation
- [x] Create project structure (HTML, CSS, JS files)
- [x] Implement core data model (lanes, boxes, timeline)
- [x] Build UI layout (header, lanes panel, canvas area)
- [x] Implement lane management (add, rename, delete lanes)
- [x] Implement box creation with click-and-drag
- [x] Implement box editing (label, duration, color)
- [x] Add timeline scaling and zoom controls
- [x] Implement alignment markers between lanes
- [x] Add export functionality (PNG/SVG, JSON save/load)

## Verification
- [x] Test all features in browser
- [x] Create walkthrough with screenshots
- [x] Implement Lane Management v2 (Insert Before/After, Reorder Up/Down)
- [x] Implement Enhanced Time Display (End Time, Tooltips, Vertical Markers)

## Refinements & Fixes
- [x] Fix obscured lane control buttons in sidebar
- [x] Implement lane name word wrap and resizable lane headers
- [x] Fix vertical dashed lines visibility in Chrome/Safari
- [x] Implement robust auto-update for time markers during drag/resize
- [x] Implement 16-color palette with per-lane base colors and box color variation
- [x] Design smart start-time picker (set start from another box's end)
- [x] Remove static default lanes
- [x] Redesign time markers: Horizontal text, smart collision shifting, color-coded

## Phase 2 Improvements
- [x] Backup application files
- [x] Fix lane control layout (compact hover strip, delete button integration)
- [x] Ensure vertical dashed lines are visible even with single lane
- [x] Implement minimum drag threshold for box creation (ignore single click)
- [x] Add vertical alignment lines to SVG/PNG exports
- [x] Display 16-color palette in properties panel for manual selection
- [x] Fix name editing accessibility (controls don't block input)

## Phase 3 Refinements
- [ ] Fix PNG export (Vertical alignment lines missing)
- [ ] Increase "Timeline Diagram" title input width
- [ ] Implement Page-wide Settings (Time format threshold ms/s)
- [ ] Save/Load settings in JSON
- [ ] Improve Color Palette (Distribute close colors, Lane color picker)
- [ ] Auto-adjust box colors based on lane color with increased contrast
